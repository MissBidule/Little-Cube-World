# Little Cube World

This project is a Third Person view environment in C++ and OpenGL where you can explore and see the place moving around and light up at night.

**It works on all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS).**

## Information about the project

The project has been made based on this [repository](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Learn--OpenGL--TPs-Template). 

It can easily be compiled with CMake and is using Assimp library. You don't have to download Assimp, it is included in the repository.

The goal of this project is to experiment with lights, shadows and animations with OpenGL and create Boids behaviour.
